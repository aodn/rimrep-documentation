## Deploying a cluster

There's a [terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest)
that seems to have everything we need in it. And there are some
[reference deployments](https://github.com/clowdhaus/eks-reference-architecture/tree/main/self-managed-node-group)
of that module. There's still a lot of decisions to be made about how to deploy a
cluster.
